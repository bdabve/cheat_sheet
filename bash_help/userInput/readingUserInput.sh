\e[1;4mReading from a file:\e[0m

â€¢ The tricky part is getting the data from the file to the read command. The most common method is to pipe the result of the cat command of the file directly to a while command that contains the read command. 
	# Here's an example:	
	\e[0;32mcount=1
	cat test | while read line;do
		echo \"Line $count: $line\"
		count=$[ $count + 1]
	done
	echo \"Finished processing the file\"\e[0m"
