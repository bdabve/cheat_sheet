## The Basic of bc:

# The bash calculator recognizes these:
    * Numbers (both integer and floating point).
    * Variables (both	simple variables and arrays).
    *	Comments (lines	starting with a	pound sign or the C language /*	\*/ pair)
    *	Expressions.
    *	Programming statements (such as if-then statements).
    *	Functions.
    *
# The floating-point is controlled by a built-in variable called scale.
# You must set this value to the desired number of decimal places you want in your answers:
