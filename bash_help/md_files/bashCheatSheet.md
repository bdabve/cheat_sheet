## Basic Shell Options:

| Option    | Meaning
| ----------|-----------------------------------------------
| emacs     | Enters emacs editing mode (on by default)
| ignoreeof | Doesn't allow use of a single CTRL-D tolog off; use the exit command to log off emmediately
| noclobber | Doesn't allow output redirection (>) to overwrite an existing file
| noglob    | Doesn't expand filename wildcards like * and ? (wildcard expansion is sometimes called globbing)
| nounset   | Indicates an error when trying to use a variable that is undefined
| vi        | Enters vi editing mode

* There are several other options (21 in all). 
* To check the status of an option, just type `set -o`

  ```bash
  $ set -o optionName           # Turn optionName On
  $ set +o optionName           # Turn optionName Off
  ```

* `shopt`: is a built-in cmd is meant as a replacement for option configuration originally done through environment variables and the set cmd.

| Option    | Meaning
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------
| -p        | Desplay settable option and their current value
| -s        | Sets each option name
| -u        | Unset each option name
| -q        | Suppesses normal output, the return status indicates if a variable is set or unset
| -o        | Allows the values of of the option names to be those defined for the -o option of the set

## DEBUGGING SHELL PROGRAMS

| Command             | Meaning                                    |

| bash -v scriptname  | echo commands before running them
| set -o verbose      | alternative (set option in script)
| bash -x scriptname  | echo commands after command-line processing
| set -o xtrace       | alternative (set option in script)
| trap 'echo $varname' EXIT  | useful when you want to print out the values of variables at the point that your script exits

## The Linux Error Exit Status:

| Error  | Meaning
|--------|---------------------------------------------
| 0      | Successfull completion of the command
| 1      | General unknown error
| 2      | Misuse of shell command
| 126    | The command can't execute

| 128+x  | Fatal error with linux signal x
| 130    | Command terminated with Ctrl+C
| 255    | Exit status out of range

## Linux Signal:

* There are more than 30 Linux signal can be generated by the system
* This table lists the most common Linux Systeme signal.

## COMMAND-LINE PROCESSING CYCLE


## INPUT/OUTPUT REDIRECTORS



| `>|file`     | forces standard output to file even if noclobber is set
| `n>|file`    | forces output to file from file descriptor n even if noclobber is set
| `<> file`    | uses file as both standard input and standard output
| `n<>file`    | uses file as both input and output for file descriptor n

| `n>&`        | duplicates standard output to file descriptor n
| `n<&`        | duplicates standard input from file descriptor n
| `n>&m`       | file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the output file descriptor
| `n<&m`       | file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the input file descriptor
| `&>file`     | directs standard output and standard error to file
| `<&-`        | closes the standard input
| `>&-`        | closes the standard output
| `n>&-`       | closes the ouput from file descriptor n
| `n<&-`       | closes the input from file descripor n
