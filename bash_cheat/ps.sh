# The GNU ps command thatâ€™s used in Linux systems supports three different types of com-mand line parameters:
    * Unix-style parameters, which are preceded by a dash
    * BSD-style parameters, which are not preceded by a dash
    * GNU long parameters, which are preceded by a double dash

| Output    | Meaning
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------
| UID       | The user responsible for launching the process
| PID       | The process ID of the process
| PPID      | The PID of the parent process (if a process is started by another process)
| C         | Processor utilization over the lifetime of the process
| STIME     | The system time when the process started
| TTY       | The terminal device from which the process was launched
| TIME      | The cumulative CPU time required to run the process
| CMD       | The name of the program that was started

[+] When we use the $Green$ ps -l$colorOff

* F       : System flags assigned to the process by the kernel.
* S       : The state of the process.
    - O   : running on processor.
    - S   : sleeping.
    - R   : runnable, waiting to run.
    - Z   : zombie, process terminated but parent not available.
    - T   : process stopped.
* PRI     : The priority of the process (higher numbers mean lower priority).
* NI      : The nice value, which is used for determining priorities.
* ADDR    : The memory address of the process.
* SZ      : Approximate amount of swap space required if the process was swapped out.
* WCHAN   : Address of the kernel function where the process is sleeping.

    $Green$ ps l$colorOff

- VSZ  : The size in kilobytes of the process in memory.
- RSS  : The physical memory that a process has used that isn't swapped out.
- STAT : A two-character state code representing the current process stat
    - < : The process is running at high priority.
    - N : The process is running at low priority.
    - L : The process has pages locked in memory.
    - s : The process is a session leader.
    - l : The process is multi-threaded.
    - + : The process is running in the foreground.
