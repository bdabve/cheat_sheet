* There are also a couple of jQuery methods that are for use with standard JavaScript objects, and which make handling them a lot  simpler. These are `$.each`, and `$.map`, which are similar but have subtle differences.

## The `$.each` Method: 

* Using `$.each`, you can iterate through arrays or array-like objects by simply attaching a function to be called for each iteration. 

  ```javascript
  pets = {
        Scratchy : 'Guinea Pig',
        Squeeky  : 'Guinea Pig',
        Fluffy   : 'Rabbit',
        Thumper  : 'Rabbit',
        Snoopy   : 'Dog',
        Tiddles  : 'Cat'
  }
  guineapigs = []
  $.each(pets, function(name, type) {
    if (type == 'Guinea Pig') guineapigs.push(name)
  })
  $('#info').html('The guinea pig names are: ' + guineapigs.join(' & '))
  ```

## The `$.map` Method:

* Another way to achieve this is with the `$.map` method, which returns all the values that your function returns in an array, saving you from having to create an array, and then push matches onto itâ€”as we had to in the preceding example.
    
  ```javascript
  pets = {
        Scratchy : 'Guinea Pig',
        Squeeky  : 'Guinea Pig',
        Fluffy   : 'Rabbit',
        Thumper  : 'Rabbit',
        Snoopy   : 'Dog',
        Tiddles  : 'Cat'
  }
  guineapigs = $.map(pets, function(type, name) {
    if (type == 'Guinea Pig') return name
  })
  $('#info').html('The guinea pig names are: ' + guineapigs.join(' & '))
  ```

> `$.each` passes arguments to the function in the order (index, value), but map uses the order (value, index).
