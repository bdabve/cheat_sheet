# <center>Effects</center>

* jQuery effects, supports up to three arguments, as follows: 

  * `No Arguments`: The method is called immedately without being placed in the animation queue.
  * `Duration`: Which can be a value in milliseconds, or the strings `fast` or `slow`
  * `Easing`: There are only two easing options in the jQuery Lib, `swing`, `linear`.
  * `Callback`: If you supply a callback function, it will be called after the effect method completes.

  ```javascript
  $('#object').hide()
  $('#object').hide(1000)
  $('#object').hide('fast')
  $('#object').hide('linear')
  $('#object').hide('slow', 'linear')
  $('#object').hide(myfunction)
  $('#object').hide(333, myfunction)
  $('#object').hide(200, 'linear', function() { alert('Finished!') } )
  ```


## Hiding and Showing

  ```html
  <button id='hide'>Hide</button>
  <button id='show'>Show</button>
  <p id='text'>Click the Hide and Show buttons</p>
  <script>
      $('#hide').click(function() { $('#text').hide('slow', 'linear') })
      $('#show').click(function() { $('#text').show('slow', 'linear') })
  </script>
  ```
* [Cours Example](./html/3.1-hidingAndShowing.html)


## The toggle Method

* The toggle method takes the same arguments as `hide` and `show` but keeps  internal track of the state of the element so that it knows whether to `hide` or `show` it.

  ```html
  <button id='toggle'>Toggle</button>
  <p id='text'>Click the Toggle button</p>
  <script>
      $('#toggle').click(function() { $('#text').toggle('slow', 'linear') })
  </script>
  ```

* [Cours Example](./html/3.2-ToggleMethod.html)


## Fading In and Out

* There are four methods for managing fades: `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `fadeToggle`, and `fadeTo`. 

  `fadeTo`: Let you specify an opacity value to which an element should be faded, between 0 and 1.

  ```html
  <button id='fadeout'>fadeOut</button>
  <button id='fadein'>fadeIn</button>
  <button id='fadetoggle'>fadeToggle</button>
  <button id='fadeto'>fadeTo</button>
  <p id='text'>Click the buttons above</p>
  <script>
      $('#fadeout').click(function() { $('#text').fadeOut('slow') })
      $('#fadein').click(function() { $('#text').fadeIn('slow') })
      $('#fadetoggle').click(function() { $('#text').fadeToggle('slow') })
      $('#fadeto').click(function() { $('#text').fadeTo('slow', 0.5) })
  </script>
  ```

* [Cours Example](./html/3.3-fade.html)

## Sliding Elements Up and Down

* There are three methods available to do this: `slideDown`, `slideUp`, and `slideToggle`. They work in a similar way to the previous functions.

  ```html
  <button id='slideup'>slideUp</button>
  <button id='slidedown'>slideDown</button>
  <button id='slidetoggle'>slideToggle</button>
  <div id='para' style='background:#def'>
      <h2>From A Tale of Two Cities - By Charles Dickens</h2>
      <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
      wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
      the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
      Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
      everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to
      Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so
      far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted
      on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of
      comparison only</p>
  </div>
  <script>
      $('#slideup').click(function() { $('#para').slideUp('slow') })
      $('#slidedown').click(function() { $('#para').slideDown('slow') })
      $('#slidetoggle').click(function() { $('#para').slideToggle('slow') })
  </script>
  ```

* [Cours Example](./html/3.4-Sliding.html)

## Animations

* You must remember to first give your elements position properties, values of `relative`, `fixed`, or `absolute`. 

* To animate an element, all you do is supply a list of CSS properties (excluding colors) to the animate method.
  
  Unlike the previous effects methods, animate requires this list of properties first, and then you can supply any duration, easing, and callback arguments you need.

  ```html
  <head>
      <style>
        #ball {
          position  :relative;
        }
        #box {
          width     :640px;
          height    :480px;
          background:green;
          border    :1px solid #444;
        }
      </style>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div id='box'>
          <p id='ball'> Hello </p>
      </div>
      <script>
        bounce()
        function bounce()
        {
          $('#ball')
            .animate( { left:'270px', top :'380px' }, 'slow', 'linear')
            .animate( { left:'540px', top :'190px' }, 'slow', 'linear')
            .animate( { left:'270px', top :'0px'   }, 'slow', 'linear')
            .animate( { left:'0px',   top :'190px' }, 'slow', 'linear')
        }
      </script>
  </body>
  ```

* Using callbacks: You can use a callback function to make the animation start over again every time it completes. 

 Now that the animation is in a function named bounce, it is only necessary to add that name as a callback to the fourth animation in the group in order to make the animation repeat forever, as shown here: 

  ```javascript
   $('#ball').animate( { left:'0px', top :'190px' }, 'slow', 'linear' , bounce)
  ```

* [Cours Example](./html/3.5-Animation.html)

### Stopping Animations

* There are several methods available for cutting off animations midway through, or ending a chain of animations. 
* For example, with `clearQueue` you can empty all stored animations that are queued up, with `stop` you can immediately stop any animation currently in  progress, or the `finish` method will stop the currently running animation, and remove any that are queued.

* So let’s turn the previous example into a sort of game by making the ball clickabl, such that when the click event triggers, the animation will cease. 
  
  To do this, all that’s required is to add the following single line of code underneath the bounce function:

  ```javascript
    $('#ball').click(function() { $(this).finish() })
  ```
