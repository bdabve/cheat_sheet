# <center>PHP Object</center>

## Declaring a Class

```php
$object = new User;                 # Creating an object with a specified class.
$temp = new User('name', 'pass')    # We pass parameters to the call

print_r($object); echo "<br>";      # print_r: asks PHP to display information about a variable in human-readable form.

$object->name ='Joe';               # Accessing an object's property ($object->property.)
$object->password ='mypass';

$object->save_user();               # To call a method ($object->method()).


class User{
  public $name, $password;

  function save_user(){
      echo "Save user code goes here"
  }
}
```

- Another example

  ```php
  class Membre {
    private $pseudo;
    private $email;
    private $signature;
    private $actif;

    public function envoyerEMail($titre, $message) {
      mail($this->email, $titre, $message);
    } 

    public function bannir(){
      $this->actif = false;
      $this->envoyerEMail('Vous avez été banni', 'Ne revenez plus !');
    } 

    public function getPseudo() {
      return $this->pseudo;
    } 
    
    public function setPseudo($nouveauPseudo) {
      if (!empty($nouveauPseudo) AND strlen($nouveauPseudo) < 15){
        $this->pseudo = $nouveauPseudo;
      }
    }
  }

  # Usage:
  $membre = new Membre;
  $membre->setPseudo('M@teo21');    # OK car setPseudo est public
  $membre->pseudo = 'M@teo21';      # Interdit car $pseudo est private
  ```

### Cloning Objects

```php
$object1 = new User();
$object1->name = "Alice";

$object2 = clone $object1;      # Using the clone operator, which creates a new instance of the class and copies the property value.
$object2->name = "Amy";

echo "object1 name = " . $object1->name. "<br>";
echo "object2 name = " . $object2->name;

class User{
  public $name;
}
# OUTPUT
object1 name = Alice
object2 name = Amy
```

### Constructors

* When creating a new object, you can pass a list of arguments to the class being called. 
* These are passed to a special method within the class, called the constructor, which initializes various properties.
* Like `__ini__()` in python
  
  ```php
  class User{

    function __construct($param1, $param2){
      # Constructor statements go here
      public $username = "Guest";
    }
  }
  ```

### Destructors

* This ability is useful when code has made the last reference to an object or when a script reaches the end.

  ```php
  class User{
      function __destruct(){
        # Destructor code goes here
      }
  }
  ```

### Writing Methods

- The `this` keyword is like `self` in python.
- and you can use `self`

  ```php
  class User{
      public $name, $password;

      function get_password(){
          return $this->password;
      }
  }

  $object = new User;
  $object->password = "secret";

  echo $object->get_password();
  ```

### Static Methods in PHP 5

* If you are using PHP 5, you can also define a method as static, which means that it is called on a class, not on an object. A static method has no access to any object properties and is created and accessed like this: 

* Static function are useful for performing action relating to the class itself, but not to specific instance of the class.

  ```php

  User::pwd_string();     # Call the class itself, along with the static method, using a double colon.

  class User{
    static function pwd_string(){
      echo "Please enter your password";
    }
  }

  ```

### Declaring Properties

* It is not necessary to explicitly declare properties within classes, as they can be implicitly defined when first used.
* I advise that you get into the habit of always declaring your properties explicitly within classes. You’ll be glad you did.
* Also, when you declare a property within a class, you may assign a default value to it. The value you use must be a constant and not the result of a function or expression.

  ```php
  $object1 = new User();
  $object1->name = "Alice";

  echo $object1->name;

  class User {}
  ```

#### Valid and Invalid Property Declarations

```php
class Test{
  public $name = "Paul Smith";      # Valid
  public $age = 42;                 # Valid
  public $time = time();            # Invalid - calls a function
  public $score = $level * 2;       # Invalid - uses an expression
}
```

### Declaring Constants

* You can define constants inside classes. The generally accepted practice is to use upper‐case letters to make them stand out.

```php
Translate::lookup();

class Translate{
  const ENGLISH = 0;
  const SPANISH = 1;
  const FRENCH = 2;
  const GERMAN = 3;
  # ...

  static function lookup(){
    echo self::SPANISH;
  }
}
```

### Property and Method Scope in PHP 5 

| Property | Meaning 
| ---------|---------------------------------------
| public | These properties are the default when you are declaring a variable using the var or public keywords, or when a variable is implicitly declared the first time it is used.  The keywords var and public are interchangeable because, although deprecated, var is retained for compatibility with previous versions of PHP. Methods are assumed to be public by default.
| protected | These properties and methods (members) can be referenced only by the object’s class methods and those of any subclasses.
| private | These members can be referenced only by methods within the same class—not by subclasses.

#### Here's how to decide which you need to use:

| Property | When to use 
| ---------|---------------------------------
| public | When outside code should access this member and extending classes should also inherit it.
| protected | When outside code should not access this member but extending classes should inherit it.
| private | When outside code should not access this member and extending classes also should not inherit it.

> Toutes les variables d'une classe doivent toujours être privées ou protégées

> Et si vous voulez modifier des variables vous devez passer par des fonctions setVariable, na !

```php
class Example{
  var $name = "Michael"         # Same as public but deprecated
  public $age = 23;             # Public property
  protected $usercount;         # Protected property

  private function admin(){
    # Private method
    # Admin code goes here
  }
}
```

### Static Properties and Methods

```php
$temp = new Test();
echo "Test A: " . Test::$static_property . "<br>";
echo "Test B: " . $temp->get_sp() . "<br>";
echo "Test C: " . $temp->static_property . "<br>";

class Test {
  static $static_property = "I'm static";

  function get_sp(){
    return self::$static_property;
  }
}

# Output
Test A: I'm static
Test B: I'm static
Notice: Undefined property: Test::$static_property
Test C:
```

## Inheritance

* Once you have written a class, you can derive subclasses from it. This can save lots of painstaking code rewriting: you can take a class similar to the one you need to write, extend it to a subclass, and just modify the parts that are different. You achieve this using the `extends ` operator.

  ```php
  $object = new Subscriber;
  $object->name = "Fred";
  $object->password = "pword";
  $object->phone = "012 345 6789";
  $object->email = "fred@bloggs.com";
  $object->display();

  class User
  {
    public $name, $password;
    function save_user() {
      echo "Save User code goes here";
    }
  }

  class Subscriber extends User
  {
    public $phone, $email;
    function display() {
      echo "Name:     " . $this->name     . "<br>";
      echo "Pass:     " . $this->password . "<br>";
      echo "Phone:    " . $this->phone    . "<br>";
      echo "Email:    " . $this->email;
    }
  }
  ```

* The original User class has two properties, $name and $password , and a method to save the current user to the database. Subscriber extends this class by adding an additional two properties, $phone and $email , and includes a method of displaying the properties of the current object using the variable $this , which refers to the cur‐ rent values of the object being accessed.

#### The parent operator

```php
$object = new Son;
$object->test();
$object->test2();

class Dad
{
  function test() {
    echo "[Class Dad] I am your Father<br>";
  }
}

class Son extends Dad
{
  function test() {
    echo "[Class Son] I am Luke<br>";
  }

  function test2(){
    parent::test();
  }
}
```
* This code creates a class called Dad and then a subclass called Son that inherits its properties and methods, and then overrides the method test . Therefore, when line 2 calls the method test , the new method is executed. The only way to execute the over‐ ridden test method in the Dad class is to use the parent operator, as shown in func‐ tion test2 of class Son.

#### Subclass constructors

* If you write a method in a subclass with the same name as one in its parent class, its statements will override those of the parent class. Sometimes this is not the behavior you want, and you need to access the parent’s method. To do this, you can use the `parent` operator

  ```php
  $object = new Tiger();
  echo "Tigers have...<br>";
  echo "Fur: " . $object->fur . "<br>";
  echo "Stripes: " . $object->stripes;

  class Wildcat
  {
    public $fur; # Wildcats have fur
    function __construct() {
      $this->fur = "TRUE";
    }
  }

  class Tiger extends Wildcat
  {
    public $stripes; # Tigers have stripes
    function __construct() {
      parent::__construct(); # Call parent constructor first
      $this->stripes = "TRUE";
    }
  }
  ```

#### Final methods

* When you wish to prevent a subclass from overriding a superclass method, you can use the `final` keyword.

  ```php
  class User
  {
    final function copyright() {
      echo "This class was written by Joe Smith";
    }
  }
  ```
