# <center>Loops</center>

## The for loops:

- Syntax:

  ```php
  for ($leap = 2004; $leap < 2050; $leap = $leap + 4){
    echo "<p>$leap</p>";
  }

  for ($count = 1; $count <= 12; ++$count)
    echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12 . "<br>";
  ```

- Breaking

  ```php
  $fp = fopen("text.txt", 'wb');
  for ( $j = 0; $j < 100 ; ++$j ) {
      $written = fwrite($fp, "data");
      if ( $written == FALSE ) break;           # or if ( !$written ) break;
  }
  $fp.close();
  ```

### Loops + Arrays = ForEach: 

* The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over each element of an objectâ€”which makes it perfect for use with arrays!.

  ```php
  $langs = array("JavaScript", "HTML/Css", "Bash", "PHP", "Python");
  foreach ($langs as $lang){
      echo "<li>$lang</li>";
  }
  ```

## While loop:

```php
$fuel = 10;
while ($fuel > 1) {
    # Keep driving...
    echo "There's enough fuel";
}

$count = 1;
while( $count <= 10 ){
    echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12 . "<br>";
    ++$count
}
```

- Shorthand version

  ```php
  $count = 0;
  while (++$count <= 12)
      echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12 . "<br>";
  ```

- Alternative Syntax

  ```php
  $var = 1;
  while($var < 10):
      echo "<p>Iteration Number: {$var}</p>";
      $var ++;
  endwhile;
  ```

## Do while loop:

- `do...while` Loop, used when you want a block of code to be executed at least once and made conditional only after that.

  ```php
  $count = 1
  do
      echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12 . "<br>";
  while ( ++$count <= 12 );

  # usefull example
  $loopCond = false;
  do { 
    echo "<p>The loop ran even though the loop condition is false.</p>";
  } while ($loopCond == true);
  ```
