# <center>Session & Cookies</center>


## Using Cookies in PHP:

* As your web projects grow larger and more complicated, you will find an increasing need to keep track of your users. 
* Even if you aren’t offering logins and passwords, you will still often need to store details about a user’s current session and possibly also recognize her when she returns to your site.

* Several technologies support this kind of interaction, ranging from simple browser cookies to session handling and HTTP authentication. 
* Between them, they offer the opportunity for you to configure your site to your users’ preferences and ensure a smooth and enjoyable transition through it.

* A cookie is an item of data that a web server saves to your computer’s hard disk via a web browser. 
* It can contain almost any alphanumeric information (as long as it’s under 4 KB) and can be retrieved from your computer and returned to the server.

* Common uses include session tracking, maintaining data across multiple visits, holding shopping cart contents, storing login details, and more.

* Because of their privacy implications, cookies can be read only from the issuing domain. 
* In other words, if a cookie is issued by, for example, `oreilly.com`, it can be retrieved only by a web server using that domain. 
* This prevents other websites from gaining access to details for which they are not authorized.


## Setting a Cookie

```php
setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);
```

* Create a cookie with the name 'username', value 'Hannah', accessible across the entire server, removed in seven days

  ```php
  setcookie('username', 'Hannah', time() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, '/');
  ```

*  Create a cookie with the name 'pseudo', value 'dabve', removed in one year, and use HttpOlny

  ```php
  setcookie('pseudo', 'dabve', time() + 365*24*3600, null, null, false, true);
  ```

| Parameter | Description | Example
| ----------|-------------|-----------
| name | The name if the cookie. This is the name that your server will use. | username |
| value | The value of the cookie, or the cookie's contents. This can contain up to 4kb of alphanumeric text | Hannah |
| expire | (Optional) Unix timestamp of the expiration date, you will probably use time() plus a number of second. | time() + 2592000 |
| path | (Optional) The path of the cookies on the server.If this is a `/`, the cookies is available over the entire server | / |
| domain | (Optional) The internet domain of the cookies. | .webserver.com |
| secure | (Optional) Whether the cookie must use a secure connction. | FALSE |
| httponly | (Optional) Whether the cookie must use the HTTP protocol, if TRUE, scripting language such JS connot access cookie | FALSE |

## Accessing a Cookie

```php
if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) $username = $_COOKIE['username'];
```

* To delete a cookie, you must issue it again and set a date in the past.
* It is important for all parameters in your new `setcookie` call except the timestamp to identical to the parameters when the cookie was first issued; otherwise, the deletion wil fail.
  
  ```php
  setcookie('username', 'Hannah', time() - 2592000, '/');
  ```

## HTTP Authentication

* `HTTP` authentication uses the web server to manage users and passwords for the application. 
* It’s adequate for most applications that ask users to log in, although some applications have specialized needs or more stringent security requirements that call for other techniques.

  ```php
  $username = 'admin';
  $password = 'lemein';

  if (isset($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']) && isset($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'])) {
    if ($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] == $username && $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW']){
      echo "Welcome $username";
    } else {
      die("Invalid Username / Password combination");
    }
  } else {
    header('WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Restricted Section"');
    header('HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized');
    die("Please enter your username and password");
  }
  ```

## Storing Usernames and Passwords

* Using the PHP `hash` function: `$token = hash('rpemd123', 'mypass')`
* `ripemd`: Algorithm, wich was designed by the open academic community and which like `md5` return a 32-char hexadecimal number.

## Salting:

* Unfortunately, `hash` on its own is not enough to protect a database of passwords, because it could still be susceptible to a brute force attack that uses another database of known 32-character hexadecimal tokens.

* Thankfully, though, we can put a spanner in the works of any such attempts by `salting` all the passwords before they are sent to `hash`. 
* Salting is simply a matter of adding some text that only we know about to each parameter to be encrypted 

  `$token = hash('ripemd123', 'saltstringmypassword');`

* The text saltstring has been prepended to the password. 
* Of course, the more obscure you can make the salt, the better. I like to use salts such as this: 
  
  `$token = hash('ripemd128', 'hqb%$tmypasswordcg*l');`

* All you have to do when verifying someone’s login password is to add these same random strings back in before and after it, and then check the resulting token from a hash call against the one stored in the database for that user.

# <center>Using Sessions</center>

## Starting a session

* Starting a session requires calling the PHP function `session_start` before any HTML has been output, similarly to how cookies are sent during header exchanges.
* Then, to begin saving session variables, you just assign them as part of the `$_SESSION` array, like this
  `$_SESSION['var'] = $value;`
* They can then be read back like this: `$variabel = $_SESSION['var'];`
* For more information see: 

`/var/www/html/lpmj/cookiesSessionsAuthentication/2.2.retrievingSessionVar.php  && 2.1.settingSession.php`

## Ending a session

* When the time comes to end a session, usually when a user requests to log out from your site, you can use the `session_destroy` funtion in association.

  ```php
  // A handy function to destroy a session and its data

  function destroy_session_and_data(){
    session_start();
    $_SESSION = array();
    setcookie(session_name(), '', time() - 2592000, '/');
    session_destroy;
  }
  ```

## Setting a time-out

* There are other times when you might wish to close a user's session yourself, such as when the user has forgotten or neglected to log out.
* You do this by setting the `time-out` after which a log-out will automatically occur if there has been no activiy.
  
  ```php
  ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime', 60 * 60 * 24);   // This example sets the time-out to exactly one day

  // If you want to know what the current time-out period is
  echo ini_get('session.gc_maxlifetime');
  ```

## Session Security

```php
// Preventing session hijacking

$_SESSION['ip'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];  // Authenticate users by storing their IP.
if ($_SESSION['ip'] != $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) different_user();   // Calls the function defferent_user if the stored IP doesn't match.

// What code you place in defferent_user.
// I recommend that you simply delete the current session and ask the user to log in again due to a technical error

// You can also store a copy of the user agent string
$_SESSION['ua'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
if ($_SESSION['ua'] != $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']) defferent_user();

// Or, better still, combine the two checks like this
$_SESSION['check'] = hash('ripemd128', $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
if ($_SESSION['chack'] != hash('ripemd128', $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) defferent_user();
```
